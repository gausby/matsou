Eventually this will be a helper library for working with Riak CRDT types. It will provide:

- [ ] Schemas
- [ ] Validation of data
- [ ] A pipeline interface for altering data
- [ ] Methods for persisting the changes to the database

Installation
------------

If this becomes usable it will get published to Hex. Until then it should just be installed directly from GitHub.
